[**Document Embedder Addon for Elementor**](https://bplugins.com/products/document-embedder-addons-for-elementor/) is a collection of 12 document display widgets designed for use with the Elementor page builder. It allows users to embed files such as PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, PowerPoint presentations, and Google Docs directly into WordPress pages with adjustable layout controls.

Built specifically for Elementor, the plugin helps users display document content within the page structure, without requiring downloads or redirecting visitors.
